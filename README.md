Full Breakout game for iOS, Android and Desktop

B(x)reakout

Simple breakout game that can run on iOS, Android and on any Desktop PC.
It includes 10 levels and a build in level Editor.
The idea of this project is to help new developers get into game making.
It is written in B4X. You can go to www.b4x.com and download the relevant
IDE's for free! (b4a + b4j only!)

I have implemented several animation functions and collision detection that will
help you understand how games work.
You can also download the Game in the App Store or Google Play and try it.
Just search for Bxreakout.
